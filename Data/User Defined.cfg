#
# This file can be used to add missing/unsupported processor models like this:
#
# Processor Number, Max TDP, Low Frequency Mode, Clock Speed, Max Turbo Frequency, Cores, Threads, CPU Type, BCLK Frequency
#
# Notes:
#
#        A "low frequency mode" of 0 means that the frequency is unconfirmed (use AppleIntelInfo.kext).
#        Processors without turbo support should set Max Turbo Frequency equal to the Clock Speed.
#
#
# Please report missing processor data at: https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh/issues

# This works with -turbo 1866

# L3426,45,1200,1866,3200,4,8,0,133
#
# And this one works without additional arguments.
